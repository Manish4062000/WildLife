        1. JAVAN RHINOS
      </h2>
      <p>Once found throughout south-east Asia, Javan rhinos have suffered a staggering decline in their numbers due to hunting and habitat loss. The lone wild population of Javan rhinos is one of the rarest of the rhino species—around 75
        individuals—which can only be found on the island of Java, Indonesia.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The Ujung Kulon National Park, a World Heritage Site, is the last remaining refuge of Javan rhinos. But the area also suffers from the invading Arenga palm, leaving the rhinos with less food to eat and less habitat to roam. Besides, the
        small Javan rhino population is also extremely vulnerable to extinction due to natural catastrophes, disease, poaching and potential inbreeding</p>

        </h2>
        <p>The Amur leopard is one of the rarest big cats in the world, with only around
          100 individuals left in the wild. Although their wild population seems to be stable and increasing, these leopard subspecies are still critically endangered since 1996. And there is a good reason that: Amur leopards can only be found in a
          relatively small region of the far east of Russia and north-eastern China at present.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The remaining Amur leopards face multiple threats to their survival, including habitat loss and fragmentation, prey scarcity and transportation infrastructure such as roads. However, there is hope for this rare big cat. Around 75% of their
          home range lies in protected areas in Russia and China, and they are also moving into suitable habitats outside of these protected areas.</p>

          3. SUNDA ISLAND TIGER
        </h2>
        <p>The Sunda Island tiger, or the Sumatran tiger, is the smallest tiger subspecies in the world, weighing up to 140kg. For reference, the tigers that live in the Amur region are the biggest of all the big cats where males can weigh up to
          twice as much as Sunda Island tigers. They are also very rare -&nbsp; there are estimated to be around 600 in the wild, and are only found on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Since the 1980s, the human population of south-east Asia has nearly doubled from 357 million to around 668 million in 2020. And this has had an impact on tiger numbers, which have been shrinking along with their habitats.</p>

        <p>As human settlements expand in the region, Sunda Island tigers are increasingly likely to encounter people, which could lead to a further rise in human-tiger conflict. Tiger poaching and illegal trading of tiger parts and products are also
          of serious concern to their survival.</p>

        <p>The Mountain gorilla is a subspecies of the eastern gorilla, which lives in two isolated populations in the high-altitude forests up in the volcanic, mountainous regions of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda, and in the
          Bwindi Impenetrable National Park of Uganda.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The Virunga Landscape has a history of political instability along with high levels of poverty in the region. This poses a substantial threat to mountain gorilla numbers as people have moved into areas closer to these great apes for food,
          shelter and space—over 500,000 people live near mountain gorilla habitat at present.&nbsp; Despite this, mountain gorillas are making a promising recovery with
                      conservation efforts and interventions from local and international partners and the WWF through the International Gorilla Conservation Programme. </p>
        <p>At present, mountain gorillas are currently listed as endangered species, with just over 1,000 individuals in the wild. However, multiple threats remain that can hinder recovery progress for this species.</p>

        <p>The Tapanuli orangutan is the newly described species of orangutan, listed as a distinct species in 2017. Only a single, isolated population of Tapanuli orangutans exist in the wild, which is restricted to the tropical forests of the
          Batang Toru ecosystem on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Today, these tree-dwelling primates are critically endangered with fewer than 800 individuals in the wild, making them the most endangered great ape species in the world. The loss of habitat is one of the main threats to its survival as
          tropical forests are being replaced by agriculture, mining, and hydroelectric and geothermal development. Between 1985 and 2007, over 40% of the forests in the province of North Sumatra, where the Tapanali orangutan is found, were lost.</p>

        <p>Most people will recognize the snowy owl (B. scandiacus) from the Harry Potter movie series. 
          The snowy owl is currently considered ‘vulnerable.’ What’s worse, its population numbers are decreasing rapidly. 
          These birds are particularly at risk due to their habitat.&nbsp;</p>
         <p>They primarily live north of the 60° latitude line. 
          Due to melting polar ice caps, the prey that snowy owls feed on, like mice, are also disappearing. 
          Combined with habitat loss, these factors have contributed greatly to the 85% decline in their population since 2003.</p>

          7. AFRICAN FOREST ELEPHANT
        </h2>
        <p>Deep in the dense, humid forests of West and Central Africa, you can find the elusive forest elephant, one of the two members of the African elephant species. The actual number of wild African forest elephants remains uncertain due to
          their shy nature, but we do know that they are critically endangered species and have declined by an estimated 86% over 31 years.</p>

        <p>The main reason behind the decline is due to poaching, which is frequent, widespread and intensive, especially in Central Africa.&nbsp;As well as elephant poaching, habitat loss and land-use change for agriculture and other land uses have
          resulted in fragmented habitats and increasing human-elephant conflict leading to losses on both sides.</p>

        <p>Today, African forest elephants occupy around 25% of their historic range, scattered among 20 different African nations, mostly in Gabon and the Republic of Congo.</p>

          8. HAWKSBILL TURTLES
        </h2>
        <p>The Hawksbill turtle is one of the seven species of marine turtles and is found in nearshore tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, the Indian, and the Pacific Ocean. Their numbers are believed to be between 20,000 and 23,000
          nesting turtles, although it is difficult to assess their true population numbers since marine turtles are the true ocean wanderers.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>In the last 30 years, the worldwide populations of hawksbill turtles have reduced by at least 80% as a consequence of accidental capture in fishing gears, nesting habitat degradation, coral reef damage and the illegal trade of hawksbill
          shells and products.</p>

        <p>Other human-led threats such as plastic pollution, climate change and rising sea levels could further contribute to the decline of this species in the future. At present, Hawksbill turtles are listed as critically endangered.</p>

          9. WHITE LION
        </h2>
        <p>White lions get their white or blondish white fur from a rare genetic mutation. They are not albinos. The coloration is caused by a recessive gene resulting in reduced pigmentation.</p>

        <p>White lions are exceedingly rare. They were considered to have been extinct in the wild from 1992 to 2004. In the 1930s, Europeans got to know about these unique lions. They artificially removed the lions from their natural habitat with
          the intention of captive breeding and hunting. The gene pool was further depleted due to the trophy hunting of the male lions.</p>

        <p>Later in 2004, these lions were successfully reintroduced into the wild by The Global White Lion Protection Trust. Currently, White lions can be found in Timbavati
          Private Nature Reserve and the Greater Kruger region. It is estimated that only 13 White lions are there in the wild and around 300 in captivity.</p>

        <p>Unlike albinos, White lions have dark patches on their noses and behind their ears. Their eyes are usually blue or golden, while the albinos have red or pink eyes.</p>

          10. THE RED WOLF
        </h2>
        <p>Red wolves were originally distributed throughout the southeastern and south-central United States from the Atlantic Ocean to central Texas, southeastern Oklahoma and southwestern Illinois in the west, and in the north from the Ohio River
          Valley, northern Pennsylvania, southern New York, and extreme southern Ontario in Canada south to the Gulf of Mexico. The red wolf was nearly driven to extinction by the mid-1900s due to aggressive predator-control programs, habitat
          destruction, and extensive hybridization with coyotes. By the late 1960s, it occurred in small numbers in the Gulf Coast of western Louisiana and eastern Texas.</p>

        <p>Fourteen of these survivors were selected to be the founders of a captive-bred population, which was established in the Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium between 1974 and 1980. After a successful experimental relocation to Bulls Island off
          the coast of South Carolina in 1978, the red wolf was declared extinct in the wild in 1980 to proceed with restoration efforts[clarification needed]. In 1987, the captive animals[clarification needed] were released into the Alligator River
          National Wildlife Refuge on the Albemarle Peninsula in North Carolina, with a second release, since reversed[clarification needed], taking place two years later in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Of 63 red wolves released from 1987
          to 1994[clarification needed], the population rose to as many as 100–120 individuals in 2012, but due to the lack of regulation enforcement by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the population has declined to 40 individuals in 2018, about 14
          in 2019 and 8 as of October 2021.</p>
